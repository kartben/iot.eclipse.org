<p>The Bosch Group is a leading global supplier of technology and services for connected industries. It employs roughly 400,000 associates worldwide and has revenues of over 78 billion euros per year. As a leading IoT company, Bosch offers innovative solutions that connect homes, buildings, vehicles, cities, factories, agriculture and more. It uses its expertise in sensor technology, software, and services, as well as its own IoT cloud, to offer its customers connected, cross-domain solutions from a single source.</p>

<p>Bosch Software Innovations, a Bosch Group subsidiary, is spearheading the development of innovative IoT software solutions, based on <a href="https://www.bosch-iot-suite.com/" target="_blank">Bosch IoT Suite</a>, to connect things that can transform how business operate and disrupt existing industries. The company has also been a pioneer in creating open source software communities that provide the core technology building blocks required for all IoT solutions.</p>

<h2 class="purple">Why Open Source?</h2>

<p>Bosch was an early innovator in IoT. Bosch’s strong ties to the manufacturing, automotive and consumer products industries provided insight into the new software required to improve the productivity of connected factories, connected vehicles and indeed any connected device. Bosch quickly realized that a new category of software, called an IoT platform, would be needed to connect the millions of IoT devices with existing operational technology (OT) and enterprise IT systems.</p>

<p>To be a leader in IoT, Bosch made a strategic decision to adopt an IoT platform. After an assessment, they realized there were three options:</p>

<ol>
<li>build their own proprietary IoT platform,</li>
<li>OEM an IoT platform from a third party, or</li> 
<li>adopt an open source IoT platform.</li>
</ol>

<p>Bosch did not want to risk a strategic investment that relied upon a licensing agreement with a third party so an OEM option was rejected. Bosch also saw the dominance of open source software across many software infrastructure categories and realized an open source IoT platform would probably be one of the dominant IoT platforms in the next 5 to7 years.</p>

<p>For these reasons, Bosch decided they would pursue an open source software (OSS) strategy for implementing an IoT platform for themselves and their customers. An OSS strategy would allow Bosch to create a modern open platform that would better compete with the proprietary IoT platforms that were beginning to come onto the market. An open platform would also allow Bosch to collaborate with other companies in the IoT ecosystem and enable them to provide a more complete solution to their IoT customers.</p>

<p>“Open source is the way we chose to compete with proprietary vendors,” says Caroline Buck, Product Owner of the Bosch IoT Suite. “It provides the basis for a viable and vital ecosystem where we can engage with customers, collaborators, and competitors in a completely new and open way."</p>

<p>An open source strategy also fits well into Bosch Software Innovations’ mandate to introduce new perspectives and processes that transform how the Bosch Group develops innovative software solutions. Internally, the acceptance of the OSS strategy was reviewed by key Bosch stakeholders, including legal, marketing and product owners. Initial concerns about legal issues, potential loss of IP, and transparency of code were addressed by senior management. The result was the development of a set of best practices for open source management. In fact, Bosch has been so successful with their open source management that they have now started their own consulting practice to <a href="https://www.bosch-si.com/services/overview/open-source/open-source-iot.html" target="_blank">help other companies begin an open source journey</a>.</p>

<h2 class="purple">Leaders In IoT And Open Source: Bosch And Eclipse IoT</h2>

<p>An important part of Bosch’s open source strategy was to join a community that was dedicated to building IoT open source technology. For this reason, in 2015 <a href="https://blog.bosch-si.com/developer/eclipse-foundation-bosch-strategic-member/" target="_blank">Bosch increased its membership level in the Eclipse Foundation</a> to become a strategic member and joined the <a href="https://iot.eclipse.org/">Eclipse IoT Working Group</a>. With over 35 different projects and 40 participating member companies, Eclipse IoT is the leading open source community focused on IoT.</p>

<p>Since joining the Eclipse IoT community, Bosch has created six different IoT open source projects and contributes to many other Eclipse IoT projects. The Bosch projects started with source code contributions from existing Bosch commercial projects. The open development process used by the Eclipse projects has been adopted by the Bosch Software Innovations’ product development teams. Many of the Bosch IoT Suite commercial products are now based on Eclipse IoT projects. Using an open development model allows Bosch customers to benefit from a more transparent and collaborative development process while at the same time relying upon the quality and service level Bosch provides for their commercial products.</p>

<p>“Eclipse IoT is a great platform for collaboration,” states Buck. “Our developers enjoy working closely with this community. We also find the open source development model is very attractive to recruit new developers who might want to join our company. Developers are keen and eager to work on open source, and are honored to be a part of it.”</p>

<p>Bosch now has more than 60 developers working on Eclipse IoT projects, and has contributed around 1.5 million lines of code to the open source projects. Bosch Software Innovations’ CEO Stefan Ferber, a member of the Eclipse Foundation Board of Directors, and Buck, a member of the Eclipse IoT Working Group Steering Committee, join forces to provide strategic direction to the open source IoT community. Bosch’s participation has helped to make Eclipse IoT an important source of IoT technology for the industry. Bosch’s leadership in Eclipse IoT has also helped position the company as a leader in the IoT industry.</p>

<h2 class="purple">Benefits Of Open Source</h2>

<p>Bosch is clearly seeing the benefits of their open source strategy and participation in the Eclipse community. Moving to an open development model and using open source technology has increased its attractiveness for software engineers, significantly improved their software quality and incorporated the knowledge of the industry’s best talents for Bosch’s commercial solutions, without the need to have them all on the Bosch payroll. The Bosch developers benefit from the community feedback, testing, and code contributions made to the Eclipse IoT projects. Bosch has improved the efficiency of their development teams by reusing other open source projects in their commercial products.</p>

<p>Commercial customers of Bosch IoT Suite are providing positive feedback to Bosch’s open source strategy. Companies who are looking to use an IoT platform view Bosch’s reliance on open source as a way to provide them with more freedom of choice. Customers can benefit from using Bosch IoT Suite while at the same time having an opportunity to contribute to the open source projects used by Bosch. This allows customers to gain influence over future releases and participate in a more transparent development process of the commercial product.</p>

<p>Open source has allowed Bosch to increase their pace of innovation by collaborating with other leaders in the IoT industry. The Eclipse IoT Working Group has made it easier for Bosch to collaborate with companies, such as Red Hat, Sierra Wireless, Cloudera and others. The Eclipse Foundation’s clear rules for IP sharing and decision making makes it easy to quickly start open collaborations with other organizations.</p>

<p>Bosch also sees significant value in the services provided by the Eclipse Foundation. The Eclipse Foundation’s legal and intellectual property processes enable Bosch to fully comply with antitrust laws, and provide Bosch with the legal assurance that they can successfully embed open source technology into their commercial products. The Eclipse development process is a set of best practices that have guided Bosch developers during the process of starting open source projects. Finally, the Eclipse IoT Working Group has been very successful in promoting the open source projects and attracting new developers and users to the IoT technology. This helps Bosch gain adoption of their projects, which in turn helps with promoting their commercial products.</p>

<h2 class="purple">A Bright Future For Open Source And IoT</h2>

<p>Bosch sees a bright future for open source and IoT. Their initial strategy of using open source to create an IoT platform is paying off. The plan is to continue to participate in the open source community and create innovative solutions that will benefit their customers and the industry.</p>

<p>“We have accomplished so much since we began our open source strategy at Bosch,” concludes Caroline Buck. “Open source development has enabled us to transform how we build software
internally and it is making our organization a better product company. Any company that is serious about IoT should consider an “open source first” strategy. If you are planning to do open source IoT, then Eclipse IoT is THE community we
recommend.”</p>
